The code is python, and each cell can run a little or a lot of python. I think what we have here is a medium amount of python.

This code will take all that and dump it all into a file in google drive, so that whoever ends up doing the grocery shopping (Mom) can simply look at the list and not have to worry about spreadsheets and such. It can handle duplicate ingredients, so like if somebody whats to make tacos, and somebody else wants to make cabbage stew and both those meals use cabbage, cabbage will only appear once on the shopping list (unless cabbage is spelled differently between the different instances (incidently, I don't think Colab has a spellchecker)).\n",
